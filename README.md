# Binary-classification-with-Artificial-neural-networks
Introduction 
In the field of machine learning, there is an area called Artificial Neural Network that consists of layers of interconnected nodes, often known as artificial neurons or units, these interconnected nodes form the general architecture of the network. There is an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer are the traditional divisions of the layers. Each neuron takes in inputs, processes them, and then sends an output to the layer above it. Weights are used to represent the connections between neurons in an ANN and control their strength and importance. In order to reduce the error between the projected output and the actual output, the network modifies these weights during training based on the input data and intended output. Artificial neural networks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and more sophisticated architectures like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer networks. For the purpose of this project, we will focus on feedforward neural networks.
